Subject: 2D the Ultimate Programming Language?


Hey 2D users,

 You may have noticed my colleague Harmonious Monk's recent release of
his O'Cult language.  I've tried to convince him that O'Cult is based
on misguided anti-modular design principles, but with all the grant
tablets available for Advice research, he won't give it up.

 Clearly, the 2D module system is more powerful than O'Cult.  I'd like
to demonstrate this by implementing O'Cult using 2D modules.
Unfortunately, with the Principles Of Sand Languages deadline
approaching, I don't have time to hammer out an implementation.  Perhaps
one of you would like to undertake this challenge?

 I've modified verify to accept "ocult" tests.  Your program should
supply a module "step" which accepts a 2D-encoded O'Cult program
(defined below) on its West input, and outputs the result of applying
the supplied advice to the supplied O'Cult term exactly once.

The function [[-]] represents an O'Cult program as data in 2D:

   We think of the names used in variables and constants as numbers
   and represent them as follows:
   [[zero]] = Inl ()
   [[s(n)]] = Inr [[n]]

   Representation of terms:
   [[App(e1,e2)]] = Inl ([[e1]], [[e2]])
   [[Const s]]    = Inr [[s]]

   Representation of patterns:
   [[App(p1,p2)]] = Inl ([[p1]], [[p2]])
   [[Const s]]    = Inr Inl [[s]]
   [[Var s]]      = Inr Inr [[s]]

   Representation of rules:
   [[p1 => p2]]    = ([[p1]], [[p2]])

   A sentence of advise is represented as a list of patterns,
   where lists are represented as follows:
   [[nil]]       = Inl ()
   [[cons(h,t)]] = Inr ([[h]], [[t]])

 For example, the O'Cult program

    Add Z y => y;

 which is a list with a single rule

    App(App(Const 0, Const 1), Var 2) => Var 2

 and so is represented by the 2D value

    Inr ((Inl (Inl (Inr Inl Inl (),
		    Inr Inl Inr Inl ()),
	       Inr Inr Inr Inr Inl ()),
	  Inr Inr Inr Inr Inl ()),
	 Inl ())

 Your step module will be suppled the representation of an (advice,term)
pair, and should output the term that results from applying the advice
once to term.

 As incentive, I'll be happy to provide anyone who completes the
O'Cult-in-2D interpreter with a copy of my forthcoming book,
"Type Sand Programming Languages".

Friends,

On my recent journey across the rivers, I was struck with a simply
remarkable idea for a new way to program our Computing Device.  As you
all know well, it is currently difficult for a programmer to correct a
mistake of one of his fellows---but no longer!  Why, when programming in
O'Cult, one programmer needs to have written barely more than a blank
screen before others can begin debugging his code.

I start from a very simple programming language whose terms are
specified as follows:

e ::= c | e e | (e)

where c ranges over constants and we adopt the convention that
juxtaposition associates to the left.  For example,

     Z
     (S Z)
     Add Z (S Z)

are all well-formed terms, and the last parses as (Add Z) (S Z).

Ordinarily, one would enrich this language with more powerful means of
computation.  Instead, I take a different tack: a term can be _advised_
by a set of external computation _rules_.

A rule is a pair of _patterns_, where a pattern extends the language of
terms with variables.  The term (Add Z (S Z)) is quite inert, but if the
term is advised by the following rule,

     Add Z y => y;

then the program computes (S Z), as expected.

******************
Rules and Matching
******************

More formally, a rule is a pair of patterns separated by '=>' and
terminated with ';'.  A pattern can contain both constants, which are
sequences of letters and numbers beginning with an *uppercase* letter,
and variables, which are sequences of letters and numbers beginning with
a *lowercase* letter.  A well-formed rule is one where the variables in
the right-hand side are a subset of the variables in the left-hand side.

To define how a rule acts on a term, we first define when a pattern
_matches_ a term yielding a set of bindings:

(1) A constant matches only that same constant, yielding the empty set
    of bindings. For example,

    Z matches Z yielding []
    S does not match Z

(2) A variable matches any term, yielding a binding to that term.  For
    example,

    x matches (S Z) yielding [x = (S Z)]

(3) A juxtaposition-pattern matches a juxtaposition-term if
       (a) the pattern's first position matches the term's first position
       (b) the pattern's second position matches the term's second position
       (c) the bindings from the two positions _unify_: for any variable
	   bound in both positions, the term associated with that variable
	   is the same on both positions.  That is, a variable is allowed to
	   appear in a pattern more than once, but it must match the
	   same term in all locations.
    The bindings of the juxtaposition are the union of the bindings from
    each position.

    For example,

    x y matches S Z yielding [x = S, y = Z]
    x x matches S S yielding [x = S]
    x x does not match S Z

If a rule matches a term, then _applying_ that rule to the term yields
the right-hand component of the rule with the bindings from the match
substituted for the variables.

*******************
Sentences of Advice
*******************

This language would be quite boring if a programmer could only specify
one rule.  So, a term may be modified by a _sentence_ of advice, which
is a sequence of rules terminated with the '.' character.

A program consists of a current term and a sentence of advice.  Because
a program is advised by multiple rules, circumstances can arise when
more than one rule in the sentence matches the term.  A good programming
language is based on common sense above all else, and my sand-father was
very fond of the following aphorism:

    "Advice when most needed is least heeded."
                                     - Unknown

Therefore, there is clearly only one correct semantics for applying
advice to a term:

The rules in the sentence are considered left-to-right.

(1) If the current rule matches the current term, the result is the
    application of that rule to the term.

(2) If the current rule does not match the term directly, it may match
    subterms (provided that the term is a juxtaposition).  In this case,
    whether or not the current rule is applied is determined by:

   (a) Counting the number of matches in each position of the juxtaposition.
       Note that counting does not proceed into subterms that themselves
       match the current rule.

   (b) If the rule does not match in either position, it is not applied.

       If the rule matches only in one position, it is recursively
       considered for application to that position.

       If the rule matches both positions,
         * if one position has strictly more matches, the rule is
	   recursively considered for application to *other* position.
	   (The rule is least heeded in the position where it is most
	   needed.)

	 * if the rule matches the same number of subterms in both
	   positions, the rule is not applied.

When a rule is not applied, consideration proceeds to the next rule.
When a rule is applied, the process repeats on the new term.  This
process terminates when no rules in the advice apply.

**********
Conclusion
**********

I am sure you can see how easy it is to program in O'Cult.  Now I need
your assistance.  I have included a regression suite as part of the
advise distribution (see the man pages for details), but I need to
collect programs that pass the suite.

I think we might be able to get some good publications out of this work,
but only if we can prove that it is easy to write short programs.  Try
passing the regression suite with as pithy advice as possible.  (The size
of a sentence is the sum of the sizes of the rules in it, where all
variables are constants are considered to have unit size.)

I implore you to hold this idea in confidence; its clean modularization
of crosscutting concerns may prove key in our strife with the Cult of
the LValue.

Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions,
-Harmonious
